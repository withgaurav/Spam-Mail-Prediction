* This is a Spam Mail prediction model I have created  about prediction system using Machine Learning with Python. This code sample tells us that your mail is spam or non-spam i.e. ham mail. 
* Firstly I have extracted some mail data I have both spam and ham mail. It is easier for a machine or computer to understand numbers. So I have converted those sentences or paragraphs to more meaningful numbers by data pre processing. 
* After that, I split data different libraries like sklearn.model which is used to split data into training data and testing data. Also, I have learned to extract data and covert the long text and paragraphs into meaningful numerical values so that machine learning can understand easily, In this code, I have learned to evaluate the model is performing and also evaluate the accuracy of the model into training data and testing data then training data is used to train the logistic regression model. After that Logistic Regression Model is trained. 
* If also I give a new mail then it will predict that the mail is spam or ham.
